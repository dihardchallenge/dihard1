            <h1>The First DIHARD Speech Diarization Challenge</h1>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p class="lead" align="justify">DIHARD is a new annual challenge focusing on “hard” diarization; that is, speech diarization for challenging corpora where there is an expectation that the current state-of-the-art will fare poorly, including, but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-size:18px">clinical interviews</li>
                <li style="font-size:18px">extended child language acquisition recordings</li>
                <li style="font-size:18px">YouTube videos</li>
                <li style="font-size:18px">“speech in the wild” (e.g., recordings in restaurants)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead" align="justify">Because the performance of a diarization system is highly dependent on the quality of the speech activity detection (SAD) system used, the challenge will have two tracks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-size:18px">Track 1: diarization beginning from gold speech segmentation </li>
                <li style="font-size:18px">Track 2: diarization from scratch </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead" align="justify">The results of this initial challenge will be presented at a special session at <a href="http://interspeech2018.org/" target="_top">Interspeech 2018</a> in Hyderabad.</p>

He enjoys working with large corpora such as the Associated Press newswire (1 million words per week) and even larger datasets such as telephone calldetail (1-10 billion records per month) and web logs. He earned his undergraduate and graduate de-grees from MIT, and has worked at AT&amp;T, Microsoft, Hopkins and IBM.
